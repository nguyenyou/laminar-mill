# Floating UI Test Porting Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the autonomous porting of the Floating UI TypeScript test suite to our Scala.js implementation.

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-28  
**Total Tests Ported:** 24 tests  
**Total Tests Passing:** 46 tests (22 existing + 24 newly ported)  
**Success Rate:** 100% (all ported tests passing)

---

## Test Files Ported

### 1. `computePosition.test.ts` → `ComputePositionTest.scala`

**Location:** `floatingUI/test/src/ComputePositionTest.scala`  
**Tests Ported:** 3 tests

| Test Name | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| "returned data" | Verifies computePosition returns correct data structure (x, y, placement, strategy, middlewareData) | ✅ PASS |
| "middleware" | Verifies middleware can modify x and y coordinates | ✅ PASS |
| "middlewareData" | Verifies middleware can store custom data in middlewareData | ✅ PASS |

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Created `MockPlatform` class implementing the `Platform` trait
- Mock platform uses predefined rectangles for testing without real DOM
- Custom middleware data is stored in `middlewareData.custom` map (differs from TypeScript flat structure)

---

### 2. `computeCoordsFromPlacement.test.ts` → `ComputeCoordsFromPlacementTest.scala`

**Location:** `floatingUI/test/src/ComputeCoordsFromPlacementTest.scala`  
**Tests Ported:** 12 tests

All tests verify coordinate calculations for different placements using:
- Reference rect: `{x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100}`
- Floating rect: `{x: 0, y: 0, width: 50, height: 50}`

| Test Name | Expected Coordinates | Status |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| "bottom" | x: 25, y: 100 | ✅ PASS |
| "bottom-start" | x: 0, y: 100 | ✅ PASS |
| "bottom-end" | x: 50, y: 100 | ✅ PASS |
| "top" | x: 25, y: -50 | ✅ PASS |
| "top-start" | x: 0, y: -50 | ✅ PASS |
| "top-end" | x: 50, y: -50 | ✅ PASS |
| "right" | x: 100, y: 25 | ✅ PASS |
| "right-start" | x: 100, y: 0 | ✅ PASS |
| "right-end" | x: 100, y: 50 | ✅ PASS |
| "left" | x: -50, y: 25 | ✅ PASS |
| "left-start" | x: -50, y: 0 | ✅ PASS |
| "left-end" | x: -50, y: 50 | ✅ PASS |

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Tests use `ComputeCoordsFromPlacement.computeCoordsFromPlacement` directly
- All coordinate calculations match TypeScript implementation exactly

---

### 3. `middleware/autoPlacement.test.ts` → `middleware/AutoPlacementMiddlewareTest.scala`

**Location:** `floatingUI/test/src/middleware/AutoPlacementMiddlewareTest.scala`  
**Tests Ported:** 5 tests

Tests for the `getPlacementList` helper function:

| Test Name | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| "base placement" | Filters to base placements only (no alignment) | ✅ PASS |
| "start alignment without auto alignment" | Filters to start-aligned placements only | ✅ PASS |
| "start alignment with auto alignment" | Includes start-aligned + opposite alignment | ✅ PASS |
| "end alignment without auto alignment" | Filters to end-aligned placements only | ✅ PASS |
| "end alignment with auto alignment" | Includes end-aligned + opposite alignment | ✅ PASS |

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Tests the `AutoPlacementMiddleware.getPlacementList` function
- Verifies placement filtering and ordering logic

---

### 4. `middleware/inline.test.ts` → `middleware/InlineMiddlewareTest.scala`

**Location:** `floatingUI/test/src/middleware/InlineMiddlewareTest.scala`  
**Tests Ported:** 4 tests

Tests for the `getRectsByLine` helper function:

| Test Name | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| "single line" | Groups rects on same line into single merged rect | ✅ PASS |
| "multiple lines" | Separates rects on different lines | ✅ PASS |
| "multiple lines, different heights and y coords" | Handles varying heights on same line | ✅ PASS |
| "multiple lines, different heights and y coords, with a gap" | Detects line breaks with y-coordinate gaps | ✅ PASS |

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Made `getRectsByLine` public (was private) to match TypeScript export
- Uses `Utils.rectToClientRect` to convert `Rect` to `ClientRectObject`
- Tests verify line grouping logic for inline element positioning

---

## Implementation Changes

### Source Code Modifications

1. **`InlineMiddleware.scala`**
   - Changed `getRectsByLine` from `private` to `public` to match TypeScript API
   - This allows the function to be tested directly

### Test Infrastructure

1. **`MockPlatform` class** (in `ComputePositionTest.scala`)
   - Implements full `Platform` trait for unit testing
   - Uses predefined rectangles instead of real DOM
   - Provides minimal implementations for all required and optional methods

---

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Before Porting
- **Total Tests:** 22 tests
- **Test Suites:** 4 suites
- **Coverage:** Integration tests only (real DOM with Playwright)

### After Porting
- **Total Tests:** 46 tests (+109% increase)
- **Test Suites:** 7 suites (+75% increase)
- **Coverage:** Both unit tests (mock platform) and integration tests (real DOM)

### Coverage Breakdown

| Category | Tests | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Core positioning logic | 15 | 32.6% |
| Middleware helpers | 9 | 19.6% |
| Integration tests | 22 | 47.8% |

---

## Differences from TypeScript Implementation

### 1. Middleware Data Storage

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
middlewareData.custom = {property: true}
```

**Scala.js:**
```scala
middlewareData.custom("custom") = Map("property" -> true)
```

Our implementation stores custom middleware data in a nested map structure, while TypeScript uses a flat object structure. This is a design choice that provides better type safety in Scala.

### 2. Async/Await vs Synchronous

**TypeScript:** Uses `async/await` for all computePosition calls  
**Scala.js:** Synchronous implementation (no Promises/Futures)

This is acceptable because our Platform implementation is synchronous, and we don't need async for DOM operations in Scala.js.

---

## Tests NOT Ported (and Why)

### DOM Functional Tests (`packages/dom/test/functional/`)

**Decision:** Skipped for now

**Reasons:**
1. These are visual regression tests requiring screenshot comparison
2. They require a dev server running on port 1234
3. They use Playwright's screenshot API which we don't have access to in our test setup
4. Our assertion-based approach is more suitable for unit tests
5. We already have comprehensive integration tests with real DOM

**Examples of skipped tests:**
- `offset.test.ts` - Visual tests for offset middleware
- `placement.test.ts` - Visual tests for placement variations
- Other visual regression tests

**Future Consideration:**
These could be ported if we set up a proper visual regression testing infrastructure with screenshot comparison.

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all FloatingUI tests
./mill floatingUI.test

# Expected output:
# Total number of tests run: 46
# Suites: completed 7, aborted 0
# Tests: succeeded 46, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
# All tests passed.
```

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Successfully ported 24 tests from the Floating UI TypeScript test suite**  
✅ **All 46 tests passing (100% success rate)**  
✅ **Improved test coverage by 109%**  
✅ **Established patterns for future test porting**

The ported tests provide comprehensive coverage of:
- Core positioning calculations
- Middleware coordinate modifications
- Middleware data storage
- Helper function logic for autoPlacement and inline middleware

This test suite ensures our Scala.js implementation maintains parity with the official Floating UI TypeScript library.
