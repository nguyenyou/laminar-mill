/** WebStorageVar provides a Var with persistence powered
  * by the browser's LocalStorage or SessionStorage API.
  *
  * It's scoped to one key in LocalStorage or SessionStorage.
  *
  * #Warning: don't create multiple vars for the same key in
  *  the same browser tab / frame, they will go out of sync.
  *  - To sync vars pointing to the same key across different
  *    browser tabs / frames, see `syncOwner` param of
  *    `WebStorageVar.localStorage/sessionStorage` factories.
  *
  * Note: if you push an error value into this Var, the
  * underlying browser storage will NOT be updated, and the
  * error value will NOT sync to other tabs / frames.
  *
  * Note: Users may have disabled site data (incl. LocalStorage
  * and SessionStorage) in browser settings. In those cases, the
  * Var will still work as a normal Airstream Var, but its value
  * will not be persisted in the browser.
  *  - To detect this condition, see helpers on the companion object.
