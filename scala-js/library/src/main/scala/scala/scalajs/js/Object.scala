   *  The `Object.assign()` method is used to copy the values of all enumerable
   *  own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It will
   *  return the target object.
   *
   *  Properties in the target object will be overwritten by properties in the

   *
   *  The `Object.assign()` method only copies enumerable and own properties from
   *  a source object to a target object. It uses `Get` on the source and `Set`

   *  assigns properties versus just copying or defining new properties. This may
   *  make it unsuitable for merging new properties into a prototype if the merge
   *  sources contain getters. For copying property definitions, including their
   *  enumerability, into prototypes `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()` and
   *  `Object.defineProperty()` should be used instead.
   *
   *  Both `String` and `Symbol` properties are copied.
   *
   *  In case of an error, for example if a property is non-writable, a
   *  `TypeError` will be raised, and the target object can be changed if any
   *  properties are added before error is raised.
