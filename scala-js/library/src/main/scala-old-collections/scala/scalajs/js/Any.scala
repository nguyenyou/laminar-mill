/** Root of the hierarchy of JavaScript types.
 *
 *  Subtypes of [[Any js.Any]] are JavaScript types, which have different
 *  semantics and guarantees than Scala types (subtypes of [[AnyRef]] and
 *  [[AnyVal]]). Operations on JavaScript types behave as the corresponding
 *  operations in the JavaScript language.
 *
 *  You can implement JavaScript types in Scala.js. The implementation
 *  (i.e., the method and constructor bodies) will follow Scala semantics, but
 *  the constructor and methods will be called using JavaScript semantics
 *  (e.g., runtime dispatch).
 *
 *  A JavaScript type that is annotated with [[native @js.native]] is a facade
 *  type to APIs implemented in JavaScript code. Its implementation is
 *  irrelevant and never emitted. As such, all members must be defined with
 *  their right-hand-side being [[native js.native]].
 *  Further, native JavaScript types must be annotated with one of
 *  [[annotation.JSGlobal @JSGlobal]], [[annotation.JSImport @JSImport]],
 *  [[annotation.JSGlobalScope @JSGlobalScope]] to specify where to fetch it
 *  from.
 *
 *  In most cases, you should not directly extend this trait, but rather extend
 *  [[Object js.Object]].
 *
 *  It is not possible to define traits or classes that inherit both from this
 *  trait and a strict subtype of [[AnyRef]]. In fact, you should think of
 *  [[Any js.Any]] as a third direct subclass of [[scala.Any]], besides
 *  [[scala.AnyRef]] and [[scala.AnyVal]].
 *
 *  See the [[http://www.scala-js.org/doc/js-interoperability.html JavaScript
 *  interoperability guide]] of Scala.js for more details.
